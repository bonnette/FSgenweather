<br>
A variation of my TFT_WeatherClient repository This is a newer (and different) version of my TFT_WeatherClient. It is built on a Raspberry Pi Zero using C++ and QT creator instead of Python and TK. The FS in "FSweather" stands for Full Screen.The "gen" in the name stands for "general" in that instead of grabbing data from a "SwitchDoc" weather station at the house. I use the api provided by openweathermap.com as well as QJsondocument to extract json data from the website. The Operating system is Buster vertion of Raspian. The case shown is a new version of the case and the pi inside is an older version of a pizero with an Edimax network dongle soldered to the bottom of it.
